## Anyfin Can Lethal - A plugin for Hearthstone Deck Tracker

Currently in early development. All you have to do is copy the .dll generated into your hearhstone deck tracker plugin folder and away you go :)

## Working

* Ability to track murlocs as they die for both oppoent and yourself

## Needs to be done

* Show user murlocs that have died
* understand the users current board pt1 (just get all the cards)
* Generate list of potential outcomes of casting anyfin can happen
* add modifier understanding to the game pt1 (just murlocs)
* add modifier understanding to the game pt2 (and common things that buff like Stormwind Champ)
* add modifier/board understanding for your oponent (taunt?, taunt that makes a taunt)
* generate a theoretical board for the user with max dmg calc
* generate a % chance to win calc based on possible boards and which of those will have enough  for lethal
* more from the public :)

## Contributing

Currently as this is still early I doubt I will want any contribs other than anything you notice wrong + bugs, but as I have the basic functionality to calculate lethal I will probably look for comunity improvements.
